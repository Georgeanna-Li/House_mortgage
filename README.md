Not very friendly for people who put more than half of their wage into rental!

This is a repo for calculating your monthly house mortgage payment, taking into consideration of the 
* Actual house/apartment price
* Your down payment
* Locked-in interest rate (it might be a raw estimation if you are going with variable interest rate)
* Rental income (if you could rent a room out, which most people do)
* Strata fee (boy they are a lot sometimes)
* Other fees like gas, hydro etc.
